My experience in Software Systems has faciliated improvement in coding, the ability to be versatile and gain more experience in development, database integration and basic machine learning. I am most confident in the following areas:

# Areas I am most confident in

* **Python & Google Colab**: I became more proficient in writing and testing Python code in both local and cloud-based environments.
* **Web Development**: I practiced and applied my skill in building responsive, user-friendly interfaces using HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap. I become more familarized with layout design and accessibility.
* **Django Framework**: I implemented models, views, templates and other skills integretrated with SQL databases.
* **SQL & SQL DB Browser**: I was very confident in designing and querying relational databases, integrating SQL with Django and using SQL DB Browser for schema integrated SQL databases.
* **GitHub**: I became more confortable using GitHub for collaboration, version tracking and project documentation. I practiced functions that were very applicable to daily tasks that apply to production environments like commits and pull requests.
* **User Stories & Data Models**: I learned and applied how to translate user requirements into technical specifications and designed data models that reflected business logic and relationships.

# Areas I'm weak in/Need more confidence with
---
These are teh areas which I feel less confident and would benefit a lot with further practice or expsoure:
* **Security Best Pracices**: I understand basic authentication and authorization, but I would like a deeper dive into secure coding practices, encryption and vulnerability testing.
* **Scalability and Performance Optiimization**: I have built functional systems, but I want to learn more about caching, load balancing, and optimizing performance for high-traffic applications.
* **DevOps and CI/CD Pipelines**: I have deployed projects for my courses manually but I have not had hands-on experience with automated deployment tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions or Docker.

# What I wish I knew
---


# Summary statement of capabilities, competencies and preparedness
---


# Prepardness for portfolio and prototype representative project
---



# How Software Systems integrates
---
* **For Data Analytics**: Machine learning models and dashboards are often embedded into web applications to deliver inights in real-time and are interactive.
* **For Data Management**: Backend systems rely on structured databases.
* **For Networking and Cybersecurity**: Web applications must be secure and efficient.

# Software Systems Statement
---
Software systems are the platform where data, intelligence, and security join and transform information into great user-driven experiences.
